	abstract = {A new perturbation and continuation method is presented for computing and analysing stellarator equilibria. The method is formally derived from a series expansion about the equilibrium condition F ≡ J × B − ∇p = 0, and an efﬁcient algorithm for computing solutions to second- and third-order perturbations is developed. The method has been implemented in the DESC stellarator equilibrium code, using automatic differentiation to compute the required derivatives. Examples are shown demonstrating its use for computing complicated equilibria, perturbing a tokamak into a stellarator and performing parameter scans in pressure, rotational transform and boundary shape in a fraction of the time required for a full solution.},

After a brief treatment of vector algebra in curvilinear coordinate systems the book introduces concepts such as flux surfaces, rotational transforms, and magnetic differential equations. The various specific types of coordinate system are dealt with in detail. Researchers and advanced students in plasma physics, electromagnetics, and mathematical physics will greatly benefit from this useful guide and reference book.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional equilibrium codes are vital for stellarator design and operation, and high-accuracy equilibria are also necessary for stability studies. This paper details comparisons of two three-dimensional equilibrium codes: VMEC, which uses a steepest-descent algorithm to reach a minimum-energy plasma state, and DESC, which minimizes the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) force error in real space directly. Accuracy as measured by satisfaction of MHD force balance is presented for each code, along with the computation time. It is shown that DESC is able to achieve more accurate solutions, especially near axis. The importance of higher-accuracy equilibria is shown in DESC's better agreement of stability metrics with asymptotic formulae. DESC's global Fourier–Zernike basis also yields solutions with analytic derivatives explicitly everywhere in the plasma volume, provides improved accuracy in the radial direction versus conventional finite differences and allows for exponential convergence. Further, DESC can compute a solution with the same accuracy as VMEC in order-of-magnitude less time.},

	abstract = {The DESC stellarator optimization code takes advantage of advanced numerical methods to search the full parameter space much faster than conventional tools. Only a single equilibrium solution is needed at each optimization step thanks to automatic differentiation, which efficiently provides exact derivative information. A Gauss–Newton trust-region optimization method uses second-order derivative information to take large steps in parameter space and converges rapidly. With just-in-time compilation and GPU portability, high-dimensional stellarator optimization runs take orders of magnitude less computation time with DESC compared to other approaches. This paper presents the theory of the DESC fixed-boundary local optimization algorithm along with demonstrations of how to easily implement it in the code. Example quasi-symmetry optimizations are shown and compared to results from conventional tools. Three different forms of quasi-symmetry objectives are available in DESC, and their relative advantages are discussed in detail. In the examples presented, the triple product formulation yields the best optimization results in terms of minimized computation time and particle transport. This paper concludes with an explanation of how the modular code suite can be extended to accommodate other types of optimization problems.},
